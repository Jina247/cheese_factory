## Architecture Overview

### MVVM Pattern Implementation

The app follows the Model-View-ViewModel architecture pattern:

- **Model**: `CheeseData` - Represents cheese objects with all properties
- **View**: Fragments and Activities - Handle UI interactions and display
- **ViewModel**: `CheeseViewModel` - Manages UI-related data and business logic

### Data Flow

1. **ViewModel** holds and manages all application state using `LiveData`
2. **Fragments** observe `LiveData` changes and update UI accordingly
3. **User interactions** trigger ViewModel methods that update the state
4. **Filtering and search** operations are handled through ViewModel methods

## Key Components

### CheeseViewModel
- Manages cheese list, favorites, and selected cheese state
- Handles filtering logic with multiple criteria
- Provides methods for adding/removing favorites
- Uses `MutableLiveData` for reactive UI updates

### CheeseAdapter
- RecyclerView adapter with ViewHolder pattern
- Handles item clicks and favorite button interactions
- Supports dynamic list updates for filtering and search

### Fragment Navigation
- Uses FragmentManager for navigation between screens
- Implements hide/show pattern for main tabs
- Manages back stack for detail views

## Setup and Installation
